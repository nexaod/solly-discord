Some of the strategies for P2 and P3 in particular are often done differently depending on the team and who takes you. It is quite likely you will not be asked to base for these 2 phases and otherwise will generally be following the rest of the team and following your hosts' instructions. If you are a hardcore, skiller, or new to pvm it is more likely that you will do slower methods like in the video whereas if you have some pvm experience and are looking to learn the boss you may do more strategies of a normal kill`

When we have a time planned, we will (generally) announce a day or two beforehand in ⁠reaper-ticket This will contain the day and time we are hosting the reaper cluster on. Other times our reaper team may contact you in your ticket at their discretion in order to schedule a time with you. Please be patient as all our team are volunteering their time. Also keep in mind we will try not to over-ping you so you may get less impromptu invites if you are showing offline or invisible on discord.\n\n`

The ⁠requirements page is for actual team forming, where basic requirements are specific for casual teams and to begin participating in learner hours, while advanced requirements are team-specific and are more applicable for experienced teams doing more challenging strategies.\n\n`

We have evolved this strategy over hundreds of kills to give you the best chance of first-attempt success. We have a queue of people to get through in a single cluster, so the strategy best ensures we can see everyone in the allocated time. If you`re concerned about not participating enough, don`t worry as our strategy sees you taking both base and dps roles, as well as dealing with many group mechanics by yourself all while taking little damage and having fun (which is the main part you should focus on ).\n\n"
